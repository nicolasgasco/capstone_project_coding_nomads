# CodingNomads Capstone project, Twitter analysis with tweepy

This is the final project of the Python course run by CodingNomads.

In the final version of this project, I'm using the tweepy module to fetch a big numbers of tweets containing a specific keyword (in this case, "Cyberpunk"), written in a specifi language (English), and published on a specific day (10th of December, when the game was released).

The tweets are then written to a database and analyzed.

The project also contains a legacy folder (older_scripts) with some preliminary scripts written before the final version.
