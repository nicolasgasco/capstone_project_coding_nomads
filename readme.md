# Python Twitter Analyzer
## [CodingNomads](https://codingnomads.co/) final project using tweepy and sqlalchemy

---
This is the final project of the online [Python course](https://codingnomads.co/courses/python-bootcamp-online/) by CodingNomads.

### Aim
The aim of the project is providing a series of statistics (e.g. average user count or most popular times) on a set of Twitter tweets fetched using *tweepy* and stored in a database

### Description
The project consists of a series of scripts aimed at:
1. Use tweepy to fetch 
In the final version of this project, I'm using the tweepy module to fetch a big numbers of tweets containing a specific keyword (in this case, "Cyberpunk"), written in a specifi language (English), and published on a specific day (10th of December, when the game was released).

The tweets are then written to a database and analyzed.

The project also contains a legacy folder (older_scripts) with some preliminary scripts written before the final version.
